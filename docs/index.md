ARCHEON (ΛRCHΞON) is Adam Karl Lucien's interdisciplinary causal systems framework that connects artificial intelligence, AI systems, causal AI, graph models, digital twin, simulation systems, and decision intelligence with a Prague-made cybernetic ethos. The canonical habitat for this work is https://archeon.lucien.technology; this GitHub Pages site serves as a deterministic, index-friendly publication stream for governance, infrastructure, and NOXIS-aware system analysis.

The public journal focuses on state governance, public infrastructure, policy simulation, predictive governance, systemic risk, accountability, auditability, and power structures. It also maps Industry 4.0, industrial engineering, critical infrastructure, smart cities, digital infrastructure, resilience engineering, narrative intelligence, hybrid threats, cyber resilience, and anomaly detection across Prague, the Czech Republic, Central Europe, and European systems.
