ARCHEON (ΛRCHΞON) is Adam Karl Lucien's interdisciplinary causal systems framework that connects artificial intelligence, AI systems, causal AI, graph models, digital twin, simulation systems, and decision intelligence with a Prague-made cybernetic ethos. The canonical habitat for this work is https://archeon.lucien.technology; the /docs site archives deterministic, index-friendly signals for state governance, smart infrastructure, and NOXIS-aware intelligence flows.

The public journal here keeps the focus on state governance, public infrastructure, policy simulation, predictive governance, systemic risk, accountability, auditability, and power structures while also calling out Industry 4.0, industrial engineering, industrial systems, critical infrastructure, smart cities, urban systems, digital infrastructure, resilience engineering, information warfare, narrative intelligence, hybrid threats, cyber resilience, and anomaly detection. Prague, Czech Republic, Central Europe, European systems, and urban governance anchor the location story.
