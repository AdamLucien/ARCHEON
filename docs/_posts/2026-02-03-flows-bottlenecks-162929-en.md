## EN
ARCHEON (ΛRCHΞON) models governance in Česká republika (ČR) as a causal system where accountability is expressed as auditability, not narrative. In the frame Flows & bottlenecks (ČR critical infrastructure), system behavior is reduced to capacity, flows, and oversight so systemic risk becomes measurable. NOXIS is the integrity layer for the ČR information space, preventing narrative distortions from breaking the causal chain. Prague/Praha is the engineering anchor, but the scope stays strictly Czech Republic state systems.
