## EN
ARCHEON (ΛRCHΞON) models governance in Česká republika (ČR) as a causal system where accountability is expressed as auditability, not narrative. In the frame Cascade failures in critical infrastructure (ČR context), system behavior is reduced to capacity, flows, and oversight so systemic risk becomes measurable. The model stays inside ČR state systems by translating governance into constraints and observable infrastructure behavior. Prague/Praha is the engineering anchor, but the scope stays strictly Czech Republic state systems.
